Lines of Code explanation:

Our current lines of code estimate is around 1050 lines.
However, there are around 5 functions we wrote that aren't used because we found better ways to implement the game. 

The check_phase3, check_ph_inv2, and check_words_helper2 in main.ml, and make_a_lst and json_anagram functions in game.ml are functions that are used to make API calls that generate all possible anagrams.
We don't mean to keep them in to inflate the number of lines or as "dead code", but because we would like to use them later and spent a lot of time working on those API calls.

We keep them in there for the next iteration of the game, but because they aren't explicitly called, we subtract those lines of code from our total number,
And we get roughly 975 lines of code.
